Essay 4 (assignment 1)

Assignment one was very frustrating for me. The first thing I struggled with was getting my error messages to work. I was able to get it eventually with help from a friend and realizing that I forgot a semicolon which messed up everything and made it that the whole statement did not work. But also me now realizing that I have to be more diligent about how I make my code and make sure everything I do is organize able to find my mistakes faster.
Next I had trouble with my server. I was sick for lab 13 where they went over it so I was already behind and looking over it, it made me practice googling and searching up information to understand things. 
Overall assignment one was very hard however it made me realize a lot of things, including not overthinking it and looking at it simply will make for a better result.
