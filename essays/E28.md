<h1> E28: Reflect on Coding Standards</h1>

<p>
	I also think that coding standards are great, for me, it provides me practice seeing what I am normally overlooking when I code. It makes me more aware of parts that I would have normally overlooked while coding. I also think that the coding standards are great especially if you are sharing code, if the coding standards are to par it would be easier to share and develop the same information if you were working on a group project.

	In my opinion ESLint with IntelliJ is one of the best IDEâ€™s I have used. Up to this point I have used VSCode for almost every project I have done. Although VSCode is very beginner friendly and has a lot of packages you can download. ESLint with IntelliJ to me seems just cleaner and feels better to code on. The one criticism I have about ESLint with IntelliJ is that I always have to check if the right settings are on were VSCode will always save user settings ESLint with IntelliJ sometime changes.
