	Software engineering is something a skill I developed by chance. When I decided to change my major to Business I had to take ICS 101 and our last project was to make a website. After being employed by the ICS 101 team I had to become proficient in HTML/CSS or enough to teach students how to make a basic website. From there I changed my focus in Business to MIS, because I enjoyed the idea of making things on the computer and being able to see the product. The class required for my major was JavaScript and we were assigned to make several websites with servers and JavaScript worked into it. 
	After being put through all of those classes and challenging myself to learn more, I ended up self teaching myself more about HTML/CSS and developing and fixing past projects. I’ve made sites for my co-workers to help them with their teaching, I fixed a mock website that was previously assigned to me, and I also created several basic sites to help my students with their final project. 
	Since it has been awhile since I coded in JavaScript I don’t remember once so I am treating it like I have never seen it before. I feel this way I will be able to learn more and be more diligent in learning. Career wise, it is not the path I want to take but I enjoy making sites and I want to learn more about it. I want to be able to create sites that will showcase all my work and create my own techfolio on my own website one day.
