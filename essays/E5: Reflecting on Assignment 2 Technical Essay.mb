The assignment was making a store website with a working login page and if they were new user then they would choose the registration page and then log in with a new user ID and email and having customers being able to confirm their password. There is no link because cyberduck did not let me upload it mine does not work completely. 
From this assignment I learned more about how arrays work and different loops. Even if my assignment didn’t work I got the idea of how it works and how it functions. 
I worked alone on this so when I needed help I emailed my professors or when in (kasemen) for help. I got help on my params and different loops. 
I think the main difference between the two were the amount of server side processing that’s needed and the different params one needs to call the information from the other page.  
I think I spent 10% thinking about how to do something, 60% writing code to try different things and 40% to see what breaks and why it broke and if it improves the project or if there is no use for it. 
I think something that worked well on this project was my registration page where it checked if it had a capital letter, number, and was more than 8 characters. Somethings that didn’t work well was it didn’t check the confirm password, it didn’t call the name and display it in the invoice, it would not store any of the new information and the products page would not let the invoice call from it to display the purchases. 
I think one thing I would do differently would be to ask for more help than I did, and do more server side work than a separate js, and not have it so messy so my code is all in one place.
