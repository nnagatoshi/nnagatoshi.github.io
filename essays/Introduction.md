Hi! may name is Nicole Nagatoshi and I am a sixth year at Univeristy of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently pursuing a BA Managment Information Systems at Shidler and a Minor in Information Computer Systems. I am 23 years old and I work as a Teaching Assistant for ICS 101 from Spring 2019 till my last semster (Fall 2022). 

When I first got into college I wanted to be a Music Therapist so my Major going into college was Music and Psycology. After taking a lot of classes I relized that it was not for me so then I switched my major to Psycology, then again to Accounting and finally to MIS and more recently, a minor in ICS. I would have never decide to work in computuers if it was not for my boss, Dr. Micheal Brian Ogawa, and all of my lovely co-workers. I always wanted to do something in Buissness but I also really wanted to do something in tech and to help people. 

Like mentioned before, I would have never considered an MIS degree if it wasnt for my co-workers or boss. However, I would have never decide to persue an ICS degree if I had not meet my ATA/ICS major friends and they had not encouraged me to go to a SPAWAR meeting. I was hooked right after the meeting. I relized I want to help people so what better way to try and work for the military in Security. So my goal is to Graduated with a Major in MIS and a Minor in ICS, then work for a company to gain experiance and then try and work for the Military in national Seceiruty. If they can not accept me I plan on going back to school to get a ICS undergrade or a ICS masters with a focus in Cyber Security. 

I look foward to this semester and learning a lot.
