<h1>E10: Reflect on Javascript 1</h1>

<p>
Having known HTML and CSS before this class I think Bootstrap is super useful in UI frameworks. Considering the number of different add-ons, it adds and the built-in classes, it simplifies your CSS, I wish I knew Bootstrap earlier it would have made a lot of projects I’ve done in the past easier. For example, my Moring Brew Café website build, my CSS ended being over one thousand lines, but with bootstrap I would have been able to condense it to maybe one hundred lines. One of the main examples being my NAV on that assignment, with bootstrap I could have condensed the CSS for the NAV and with bootstrap I would have been able to use the custom icons rather than resizing the icon photos into their own custom class. </p>
<p>
Bootstrap did take some getting used to, but I eventually understood it. One of the frustrating things I found was when I put a custom photo in the NAV var with bootstrap (not using one of the built-in icons) I had a hard time fixing it to get it aligned if there were words next to it. I want to practice with it more and to get more efficient at it since I see it as something very useful and timesaving. I think it was worth the time learning especially since it helped me organize my HTML and CSS better. I think implementing bootstrap into my HTML and CSS is something I would do regularly now. HTML and CSS is great on its own but like I stated before sometimes your CSS can get long especially if you are doing very detailed pages so having bootstrap is a great addition to HTML and CSS. Bootstrap in my opinion is a great investment of time to learn for any software engineer. If someone puts in the time you would be able to save time in future projects, </p>
